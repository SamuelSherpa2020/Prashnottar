# Prashnottar_FYP
This was the final year project of my Bsc.Hons Computing.

## What is Prashnottar?
Prashnottar is an android app, for students from classes 4-12, where students can choose their class, then choose their subject and then 
choose a chapter and ask questions for the topics which they don't understand. In addition to this main feature, they can also answer others' questions and get likes, Upvotes, 
and rewards for the best answers to get themselves on the leader board.

## Objectives of Prasnottar:

- Students would take help online with a specific platform developed for them.
- They don't have to always rely on school and tuition teachers to get answers and solutions to their        problem.
- Bookmarks and revision notes will help them during exams.
- Students all over Nepal will be questioning and answering, so better results and answers will be delivered.
- A friendly and competitive platform will be built for Nepali students.

## Why Prashnottar?
Nepal with a students population of more than 1 million (10 Lakh), still in 2021 doesn't have a specific robust platform for students 
to deal with their confusions, understand different concepts of science, math, and many more, ask questions, or give answers at free of cost.
